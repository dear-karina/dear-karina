      title: "The Missing Dollar",
      question: "Three people check into a hotel room that costs $30. They each contribute $10, handing $30 to the hotel clerk. Later, the hotel clerk realizes there was a mistake, and the room should only cost $25. The clerk gives $5 to the bellboy and asks him to return it to the guests. On his way to their room, the bellboy wonders how to divide the $5 among the three guests. He decides to give each guest $1 back and keep $2 for himself. Now each guest has paid $9 (totaling $27) and the bellboy has $2. Adding up to $29. What happened to the missing dollar?",
      answer: "There is no missing dollar. The guests originally paid a total of $27, which the hotel clerk has. The $2 that the bellboy has makes up the difference in the original $30. No dollar is missing."
