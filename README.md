##### 🐬 Every day, on behalf of Yejunie, I deliver a story about the marine.
>Because only the first few hundred metres of the ocean are illuminated by the sun and half the planet is constantly experiencing night time, up to 99% of the ocean is actually in complete darkness all the time. Yet this is something that we rarely consider when thinking about our oceans.

##### 🦙 Every day, on behalf of our Noah, I share an interesting quote.
>Let us dream of tomorrow where we can truly love from the soul, and know love as the ultimate truth at the heart of all creation.

##### 🦌 Every day, on behalf of dear Bamby-nie, I share a beautiful word with meaning.
> luftmensch

> > (n)  
> > An impractical dreamer, literally an air person, someone with her head in the clouds.

##### 🐺 Every day, on behalf of Silver-ho, I offer a riddle.
> A boy is hit by a train moving full speed along the tracks yet he survives with no injuries. Instead the train is derailed. How did this happen?

<details close>

<summary>🕺🏻 Reveal the answer here 🕺🏻</summary>

It was a electic toy train set he had built and accidentally stepped on the track causing the train to go off course.

##### 🐈‍⬛ OKAYY!! Lastly, on behalf of Haminie, I share a photo you may like to see.
